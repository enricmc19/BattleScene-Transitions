Transitions to BattleScene Research


Hello, my name is Enric Morales. I'm a student from the CITM (Image and Multimedia Technology Centre) of the UPC in Terrassa, and this is my own personal research under acknowledgement from my teacher [Ramón Santamaría](https://github.com/raysan5).

## What is a Battle-Transition?

Combat scene transitions are scene transitions from a segment of the gameplay or from a menu to a concrete scene, which in this case is a level or a battle scene, but transitions can be used either because we go to a different space, a different game mode or another completely different menu. Transitions are used all around every game in order to make the User Experience easier and comfortable than paying attention to a Power Point passing slides that change rudely from one to another without any care for what we see.

## Conclusions

During my research I found different forms of making transitions, either in films or videogames and found reddit discussions about how to make transitions or what's the most used or seen in both arts. And most of the people agree that it isn't needed a great effort on it, it's just a bunch of seconds for taking the player/spectator from point A to B or viceversa. So doesn't matter how simple or complicated while it makes the transition smooth without converting the transition itself into an entire videoclip, making the player loose the focus.

In brief words: Try to make it easy, keep it smooth, but remember sky is the limit, so at least make transitions according to what you're going to explain and if you want to make it a big bigger give it a try.
