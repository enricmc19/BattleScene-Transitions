Transitions to BattleScene Research


Hello, my name is Enric Morales. I'm a student from the CITM (Image and Multimedia Technology Centre) of the UPC in Terrassa, and this is my own personal research under acknowledgement from my teacher Ramon Santamar√≠a.

## What is a Battle-Transition?

Combat scene transitions are scene transitions from a segment of the gameplay or from a menu to a concrete scene, which in this case is a level or a battle scene, but transitions can be used either because we go to a different space, a different game mode or another completely different menu. Transitions are used all around every game in order to make the User Experience easier and comfortable than paying attention to a Power Point passing slides that change rudely from one to another without any care for what we see.

## How does a battle-transition work? A theorical explanation

Scene transitions work essentially as a distraction effect and a speed bump or slow pacer. 

They are a time management tool in the same way as loading screens, although there is usually not much to do on a loading screen in an interactive way, at least until recent games from nowadays interactive loading screens didn't have an extensive use. The difference between a transition is obviously the duration time, a super-extensive world that requires a certain power and load is camouflaged with a loading screen, while a simple pass to a different plant of a building in a top-down RPG from the 90's has not a huge load problem, so Screen Transitions are even used to set you into those long and boring loading screens with an animated bar and the charge percent which sometime add some images, lore from the game or brief tutorials that sometimes you never manage to read because loading time got faster than your reading time so you don't learn a game mechanic, at least not from that screen.

Scene Transitions are usually short, but they are indicators that something different is starting, but in an environment which does not have to be much different from the one you are currently seeing. They are a step from one scene to another, which must leave the previous scene frozen and depending on what happens in the new scene, in this case the Battle-Scene, modify certain parameters of the previous scene in order to maintain consistency between what happens in one scene and the other.

So if you go to the battle screen, because you found a Pokemon, once you defeat or capture that Pokemon, once you get back to the gameplay or navigation screen in Pokemon's case, that creature, can't be there in that zone because in the battle-scene you decided what happenned to that creature in the game world itself.

As a videogame development student, I thought the best way to attack the process of creating a transition manager or scene manager is literally thinking about how transitions worked in theatres. Transitions in videogames can be explained as the same way in theatrical arts, because they tend to work in the same way.

## Conclusions

During my research I found different forms of making transitions, either in films or videogames and found reddit discussions about how to make transitions or what's the most used or seen in both arts. And most of the people agree that it isn't needed a great effort on it, it's just a bunch of seconds for taking the player/spectator from point A to B or viceversa. So doesn't matter how simple or complicated while it makes the transition smooth without converting the transition itself into an entire videoclip, making the player loose the focus.

In brief words: Try to make it easy, keep it smooth, but remember sky is the limit, so at least make transitions according to what you're going to explain and if you want to make it a big bigger give it a try.
